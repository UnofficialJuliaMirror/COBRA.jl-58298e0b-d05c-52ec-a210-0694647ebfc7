The package can be used with ease when the LP problem is defined in a .mat file according to the format outlined in the COBRAToolbox [2]."

In this manual, a working installation of Julia is assumed.COBRA.jl has been tested on Ubuntu Linux 14.04+, MacOS 10.7+, and Windows 7 (64-bit). Currently, all solvers that are supported by MathProgBase.jl are supported by COBRA.jl, but must be installed separately. The COBRA.jl package has been tested with Julia v0.5+, and requires a working installation of the latest MathProgBase.jl. In order to load the COBRA model from a .mat file, the module MAT.jl is required."
